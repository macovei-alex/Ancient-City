	<h2>OpenGL Errors</h2>

	<p>GL_INVALID_ENUM, 0x0500</p>
	<p>Given when an enumeration parameter is not a legal enumeration for that function. This is given only for local problems; if the spec allows the enumeration in certain circumstances, where other parameters or state dictate those circumstances, then GL_INVALID_OPERATION is the result instead.</p>

	<br />

	<p>GL_INVALID_VALUE, 0x0501</p>
	<p>Given when a value parameter is not a legal value for that function. This is only given for local problems; if the spec allows the value in certain circumstances, where other parameters or state dictate those circumstances, then GL_INVALID_OPERATION is the result instead.</p>

	<br />
	<p>GL_INVALID_OPERATION, 0x0502</p>
	<p>Given when the set of state for a command is not legal for the parameters given to that command. It is also given for commands where combinations of parameters define what the legal parameters are.</p>

	<br />

	<p>GL_STACK_OVERFLOW, 0x0503</p>
	<p>Given when a stack pushing operation cannot be done because it would overflow the limit of that stack's size.</p>

	<br />
	<p>GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW, 0x0504</p>
	<p>Given when a stack popping operation cannot be done because the stack is already at its lowest point.</p>

	<br />

	<p>GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY, 0x0505</p>
	<p>Given when performing an operation that can allocate memory, and the memory cannot be allocated. The results of OpenGL functions that return this error are undefined; it is allowable for partial execution of an operation to happen in this circumstance.</p>

	<br />

	<p>GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION, 0x0506</p>
	<p>Given when doing anything that would attempt to read from or write/render to a framebuffer that is not complete.</p>

	<br />

	<p>GL_CONTEXT_LOST, 0x0507 (with OpenGL 4.5 or ARB_KHR_robustness)</p>
	<p>Given if the OpenGL context has been lost, due to a graphics card reset.</p>
